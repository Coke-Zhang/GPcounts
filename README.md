# GPcounts
GPcounts is Gaussain process regression package for count data with negative binomial and zero-inflated negative binomial likelihoods described in the paper "Gaussian process modelling of temporal and
spatial counts data from RNA-seq experiments".

## Installation:
1. Create and active virtual environment:

```
conda create -n myenv python=3.7 
conda activate myenv
```

2. Install R kernel and required packages to normalise [fission dataset](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/fission.html) using [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html): (Optional)
```
conda install -c r r-irkernel

conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-fission

conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-deseq2
```
3. Clone GPcounts repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:ManchesterBioinference/GPcounts.git
```
4. Install:
  * Install [GPflow](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow)
  * Install requirements and package
```
cd GPcounts
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
cd 
```
